  WordPress requires a style.css file located in the theme's root folder for
  stuff to work. However, we will not be using vanilla CSS. We're using Sass.

  Sass is a superset of CSS that adds in amazing features such as variables,
  nested selectors and loops. It's also the easiest way to customize
  Foundation. All Sass files are located in the /css/src folder.

  Please note that none of your scss files will be compiled to /css/style.css
  before you run "npm start" or "grunt" or "grunt develop".

  Please read the README.md file before getting started. More info on how to
  use Sass with Foundation can be found here:
  http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html
